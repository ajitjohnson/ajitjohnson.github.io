Hi everyone as a part of my core effort to effectively communicate science with everyone and how it shapes our world - I thought of starting a new series in what I am best at- Cancer Biology. This is going to be a multi-part series where I talk about,

- what we know about cancer and the latest research being done it
- what are the state-of-the-art technologies available to treat cancer
- why haven't we cured cancer yet despite pouring millions of dollars in cancer research and
- debunk some of the common misconceptions in cancer treatment.

Moreover, you can ask me anything regarding the science of cancer in the comments section blow and I will answer those in detail in subsequent posts.

Post-1 of #CancerResearchSeries

Since this is the first post of the series, this might be totally basic for many of you.

What is cancer?

We started off from a single to cell and have grown into a mass of billions of cells over the years. For our body to function properly, our cells need to divide when necessary and stop promptly. This process of cell division is exceptionally regulated which several check points and if something goes wrong the cell will actually kill itself for the common good. However, sometimes due to several faults this process can break down and our cells can begin to divide uncontrollably. This uncontrollable division of cells is called cancer. But it is just normal cells dividing right? Why is it so deadly? When the cells divide without stopping, they form tumors and affect the normal functioning of the organ they are at and so ultimately they lead to death.

Wait, if the cell is willing to kill itself when something goes wrong, then how does it turn into cancer (why are they not killing themselves?) Let's talk about that in the next post.

Post-2 of #CancerResearchSeries

In the previous post we talked about what is cancer and I mentioned that there are very well regulated systems in place to prevent a cell from becoming cancerous. So today, let us talk about what actually goes wrong biologically for a cell to circumvent these processes and turn into cancer.

To understand this, you need to know what happens in a normal physiological situation.

Many of you might already know that our DNA contains all the instructions necessary for our body to function normally.

The information regarding how a cell needs to divide is also encoded in the DNA. If you think of DNA as a long thread, the instructions for cell division is actually encoded in several 100's of regions of the thread (we call these genes). So when a cell needs to divide, these genes will produce molecules (called proteins) that will work together to create a daughter cell.

Philosophically, if you think about it, the cell is cloning itself (mind blown).

A typical cell division needs a - GO signal, STOP signal and a CHECK signal. A cell becomes cancerous when these signals are screwed up. You can imagine a scenario when there is a continuous GO signal but no STOP signal. The cell will continuously divide without stopping. This happens when the genes responsible for cell division are mutated. According to research findings, most cancer cells possess 60 or more mutations before becoming cancerous.

As you can see, 60+ genes need to be mutated before a cell becomes cancerous, which tell us that, we naturally have several backups to account for natural mutations. But when all backups fail, we get cancer.

So how does our DNA get mutated? Let's talk about that in my next post.

Post-3 of #CancerResearchSeries

In the previous post we talked about how a normal cell turns into a cancer cell (due to mutation in specific parts of the cell's DNA). Today let us talk about how these mutations come about.

We have 2 copies of most genes, one from each chromosome in a pair. In order for a gene to stop working completely and potentially lead to cancer, both copies have to be “knocked out” with mutations. That means for most genes, it takes 2 mutations to make that gene stop working completely (often lot more because we have a lot of backup genes). Also, our cell division itself is not error proof, so naturally if there is an error during cell division, the cell will immediately stops dividing and attempts to rectify the error. If the error is too big and cannot be rectified, the cell will actually kill itself so that it does not pass on the mutated DNA to the daughter cell.

There are 2 major types of gene mutations, inherited and acquired:

An inherited gene mutation is present in the egg or sperm that formed the child. After the egg is fertilized by the sperm, it created one cell called a zygote that then divided to create a fetus (which became a baby). Since all the cells in the body came from this first cell, this kind of mutation is in every cell in the body (including some eggs or sperm) and so can be passed on to the next generation. This type of mutation is also called germline (because the cells that develop into eggs and sperm are called germ cells) or hereditary. Inherited mutations are thought to be a direct cause of only a small fraction of cancers.

I've a lot of meetings today and have to run now. So let us talk about acquired mutation tomorrow.


Post-4 of #CancerResearchSeries

Good morning everyone. Continuing from where we left off yesterday, let us talk about acquired mutation.

An acquired mutation is not present in the zygote, but is acquired some time later in life. It occurs in one cell, and then is passed on to any new cells that are the offspring of that cell. This kind of mutation is not present in the egg or sperm that formed the fetus, so it cannot be passed on to the next generation. Acquired mutations are much more common than inherited mutations.

Most cancers are caused by acquired mutations.

Research has shown that it takes more than one mutation in a cell for cancer to occur. When someone has inherited an abnormal copy of a gene, though, their cells already start out with one mutation. This makes it all the easier (and quicker) for enough mutations to build up for a cell to become cancer. That is why cancers that are inherited tend to occur earlier in life than cancers of the same type that are not inherited.

Even if you were born with healthy genes, some of them can become changed (mutated) over the course of your life. These acquired mutations cause most cases of cancer. Some acquired mutations can be caused by things that we are exposed to in our environment, including cigarette smoke, radiation, hormones, and diet. Other mutations have no clear cause, and seem to occur randomly as the cells divide.

 In order for a cell to divide to make 2 new cells, it has to copy all of its DNA. With so much DNA, sometimes mistakes are made in the new copy (like typos). This leads to DNA changes (mutations). Every time a cell divides, it is another opportunity for mutations to occur. The numbers of gene mutations build up over time, which is why we have a higher risk of cancer as we get older.

 It is important to realize that gene mutations happen in our cells all the time. Usually, the cell detects the change and repairs it. If it can’t be repaired, the cell will get a signal telling it to die as I had mentioned earlier. But if the cell doesn't die and the mutation is not repaired, it may lead to a person developing cancer. This is more likely if the mutation affects a gene involved with cell division or a gene that normally causes a defective cell to die.

 If you had not figured it out already, different genes have different functions. Tomorrow lets talk about the classes of genes that are mutated in cancer.


Post-5 of #CancerResearchSeries

Hey guys, hope you are doing great. Without further ado, lets get into the science.

So over the past days, we established that cancer is a genetic disease and is caused by mutations in genes.

The genes that get mutated in cancer can be broadly categorized into two main categories.

1) Oncogenes
2) Tumor suppressor genes

Today let's talk about Oncogenes

Proto-oncogenes are genes that normally help cells grow. When a proto-oncogene mutates (changes) or there are too many copies of it, it becomes a "bad" gene that can become permanently 'turned ON' or activated when it is not supposed to be. When this happens, the cell grows out of control, which can lead to cancer. This bad gene is called an oncogene.

It may be helpful to think of a cell as a car. For it to work properly, there need to be ways to control how fast it goes. A proto-oncogene normally functions in a way that is much like a gas pedal. It helps the cell grow and divide. An oncogene could be compared with a gas pedal that is stuck down, which causes the cell to divide out of control.

A few cancer syndromes are caused by inherited mutations of proto-oncogenes that cause the oncogene to be turned on (activated). But most cancer-causing mutations involving oncogenes are acquired, not inherited. They generally activate oncogenes by:

- Chromosome rearrangements: Changes in chromosomes that put one gene next to another, which allows one gene to activate the other
- Gene duplication: Having extra copies of a gene, which can lead to it making too much of a certain protein

We will talk about Tumor suppressor genes tomorrow.

Post-6 of #CancerResearchSeries

Previously we talked about Oncogenes, which help in cell division and when mutated which causes the cell to divide out of control. Today lets talk about other set of genes called Tumor suppressor genes which are often mutated in cancer cells.

Tumor suppressor genes are normal genes that slow down cell division, repair DNA mistakes, or tell cells when to die (a process known as apoptosis or programmed cell death). When tumor suppressor genes don't work properly, cells can grow out of control, which can lead to cancer.

A tumor suppressor gene is like the brake pedal on a car. It normally keeps the cell from dividing too quickly, just as a brake keeps a car from going too fast. When something goes wrong with the gene, such as a mutation, cell division can get out of control.

An important difference between oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is that oncogenes result from the activation (turning on) of proto-oncogenes, but tumor suppressor genes cause cancer when they are inactivated (turned off).

Inherited abnormalities of tumor suppressor genes have been found in some family cancer syndromes. They cause certain types of cancer to run in families. But most tumor suppressor gene mutations are acquired, not inherited.

For example, abnormalities of the TP53 gene (which codes for the p53 protein) have been found in more than half of human cancers. Acquired mutations of this gene appear in a wide range of cancers.
