Let me quickly get to point. Are you a Non-Resident Indian living overseas and have not acquired any other citizenship? You can now register online to vote in the upcoming election. However, you need to go to India to cast your vote. Previously you had to be in India to apply for the Voter ID /Election card. So lets take that as a win for now. Election commission of India is currently conducting trials for e-ballots and proxy voting. Once those trials are successfully completed, there is all the likelihood that an NRI can vote from abroad. But for the upcoming 2019 election, if you are visiting India or are able to make a quick trip, please do consider registering to cast your vote.


I was surprised to learn how simple the process is. Kudos to the people who made this possible. All you need to do is to fill up an online form and it is not one of those long and painstaking forms. It took me around 5 - 7 minutes to complete it. At the end you will need to upload a passport size photo and a copy of your passport and so keep them handy. I guess if you are overseas you probably already have them on your computer or phone, ready to go.

## So here is what you need to do  

Go to:<a href="https://www.nvsp.in/Forms/Forms/form6a?lang=en-GB" target="_blank"_>Election commission of India Website</a>, FORM 6A.


According to estimates of MEA, there are about 31 million NRIs living in different countries across the world. Which makes us a significantly large chunk of the voting population.
