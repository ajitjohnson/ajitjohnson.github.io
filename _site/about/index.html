    <p>Hi everyone, umm, where do I start? I’m Ajit and I am currently a <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/ajitjohnson">Research Fellow</a> at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>I work on multi-dimensional characterization of minimal residual disease (MRD’s) in lymphoma to delineate their genetic, transcriptional, spatial and biophysical attributes at a single-cell level to identify MRD-specific vulnerabilities, thereby to shift the paradigm of lymphoma treatment from maximum tumor debulking to cure.</p>

<p>My study also catalyzes advances across other cancer types by providing the necessary platform technologies, resources and computational tools. The ultimate impact that I envision is a paradigm shift toward biomarker-based approaches for converting deep remissions of lymphomas into cures.</p>

<p>I received a PhD in cancer genetics and genomics from the University of Edinburgh. During my PhD I used large cancer datasets to identify, characterize and model immune system across different tumor types. I developed <a href="https://github.com/ajitjohnson/imsig">ImSig</a>, a network-based computational framework that facilitates the characterization of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment.</p>

<p>I am also a strong vocalist for open science. I had developed a platform to connect science, scientists, and the public. I firmly believe that proper communication between scientists and people would be extremely beneficial in tackling some of the greatest challenges that we face together as a species. To promote this, I had established a platform called <a href="https://thesurg.com/">“The Surg”</a> solely to provide a destination for people to learn about the latest research from scientists themselves.</p>

<p>Some of you might also know me from some of the social issue initiatives that I took on. You can check them out on my <a href="/media">media</a> page. Beyond these, I enjoy drawing, painting and playing basketball. If you would like to get in touch with me, text me through my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ajitjohnsonnirmal">facebook page</a>.</p>
