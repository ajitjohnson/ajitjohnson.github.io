Hello, Thank you for dropping by. Iâ€™m Ajit and I am currently a *Postdoctoral Research Fellow* at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School.

**Specialization:** Deciphering the *tumor microenvironment* by integration of high-dimensional data such as single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA sequencing, and spatial omics.

**Scientific objective:** Drive cancer therapeutics towards personalized medicine whereby we treat cancer as a systemic disease and *target the entire tumor eco-system* in contrast to our current tumor-centric approach. 

**Short term career goals:** Lead a highly interdisciplinary laboratory at a leading institute *(Assistant Professor)* that focuses on the development of experimental and computational approaches to systematically decipher regulatory circuits that underlie cancer development, metastasis, and resistance to treatment.
